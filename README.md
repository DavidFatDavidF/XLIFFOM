# XLIFFOM
XLIFF OM Repository
===================
This is a temporary repository for the [OASIS XLIFF OMOS TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xliff-omos/).

This repository is public in the sense that everyone is free to read its contents. However, the artifacts, code and documentation available on this repository have been contributed by XLIFF OMOS TC members under the OASIS Non-Assertion IPR mode. The modelling artifacts that are being developed in this repository are based on the published [OASIS Standard XLIFF Version 2.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/xliff-core/v2.0/xliff-core-v2.0.html) and on Work in Progress of the [OASIS XLIFF](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xliff/) and XLIFF OMOS Technical Committees.

Public feedback to the OM artifacts available in this repository may be submitted solely through the [XLIFF OMOS TC commenting facility](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/comments/index.php?wg_abbrev=xliff-omos).  *Active contributions to this repository will be only accepted from XLIFF OMOS TC members.* You can join the XLIFF OMOS TC from its [public webpage](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xliff-omos/). If you or your employer are not OASIS members, you'd need to join OASIS first in order to be able to join the OASIS XLIFF OMOS TC.

The current UML artifacts available through this repository are early work in progress and have not been approved at any level, either by OASIS or by the TC. After this work has been transferred to the XLIFF OMOS TC Git repository on OASIS infrastructure, work on this GitHub repository will be discontinued. The OASIS repository will continue being publicly available, just that active contributions from non-members of the XLIFF OMOS TC will be programmatically disabled, in the sense that only OASIS XLIFF OMOS TC members with valid OASIS credentials will be able to contribute to the repository. So the only practical diference is that public contributions that would be manually rejected at this point, will become impossible after the migration onto the OASIS TC infrastructure.
